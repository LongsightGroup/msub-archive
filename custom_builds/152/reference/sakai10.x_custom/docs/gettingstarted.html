<h1>Getting started with the rSmart Sakai CLE</h1>

<h2>Start up the CLE</h2>

cd into tomcat.home/bin and execute ./startup.sh to start tomcat. On windows, use the startup.bat file.

We recommend tailing the catalina.out file to watch for errors upon startup (tail -f tomcat.home/logs/catalina.out).  On windows, the log output is in a separate command prompt window.

<h2>Stopping the CLE</h2>

cd into tomcat.home/bin and execute ./shutdown.sh to start tomcat. On windows, use the shutdown.bat file.

<h2>Connecting to the CLE with a browser</h2>

<p>Once the server is up, open a browser to: http://localhost:8080.  The default logon is admin/admin.</p>

<p>Note: adjust the url depending on the name of your server and tomcat port</p>

<h2>Installation Information</h2>

<h3>/apache-tomcat/bin</h3>

This is where the startup and shutdown scripts live. Use these to start and and stop the CLE server.

<h3>/apache-tomcat/logs</h3>

This is where the server logs exist. Look at the catalina.out file for errors and information.

<h3>/apache-tomcat/sakai</h3>

This is where the CLE configuration files exist.

<h3>/files</h3>

This is where the server stores files users upload to the system.

<h3>/jre</h3>

This is the Java Runtime Environment that powers the application.

<h3>cle.sh</h3>

This is a linux init script that can be used to startup and shutdown the application automatically when the box is
restarted. It can be installed using chkconfig on redhat systems.

<p>Note: You'll want to set the TOMCAT_USER to whatever user the server should run as. Do this by modifying the
   following line.</p>

<pre>TOMCAT_USER="tomcat"</pre>

<h3>rSmart_Sakai_CLE_v2.5_InstallLog.log</h3>

This is the logs output from the installer. If the installation fails looks here for information as to why.


<h2>Configuration - sakai.properties and local.properties</h2>

<p>Should you decide to change any configuration components, it is important to
   become familiar with the settings within the sakai.properties and local.properties
   files.</p>

<p>Location: tomcat.home/sakai</p>

<p>Purpose: The main configuration files for the configuration settings in the Sakai
   CLE are sakai.properties and local.properties. Configuration values located
   within these two files govern everything from setting your institution name to
   configuring your database.</p>

<p>**You must restart the CLE for any changes to take effect.**</p>

<p>sakai.properties:  this file stores the default configuration settings for your CLE
   environment</p>

<p>local.properties:  this file stores customized configuration settings for your CLE
   environment. Any configuration values that exist in local.properties will
   override the configuration values in sakai.properties.</p>

<p>You can edit these .properties files with a text editor.</p>

<p>A complete guide (created by John Leasia from the University of Michigan) to the
   configuration values in sakai.properties and local.properties is online at:</p>

<p>https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference/trunk/docs/architecture/sakai_prope
   rties.doc</p>


<h2>Creating a Database and User in MySQL</h2>

<p>A database and privileged user must be prepared for the CLE's use. Consult your database documentation for details,
   but below are sample commands for MySQL.</p>

<pre>
C:\sakai\reference\sql\legacy\mysql\>mysql -u root -p
Enter password: ******
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g.

Your MySQL connection id is 51 to server version: 4.1.22-standard

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> create database sakai default character set utf8;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> grant all on sakai.* to sakaiuser@'localhost' identified by 'sakaipassword';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec

mysql> grant all on sakai.* to sakaiuser@'127.0.0.1' identified by 'sakaipassword';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

mysql>  flush privileges;

mysql> quit

</pre>
<h2>Creating a Tablespace and User in Oracle</h2>
<p>
On Oracle, the database character set needs to be AL32UTF8.  This can be validated with the following SQL query:
<pre>SQL> select value from nls_database_parameters where parameter = 'NLS_CHARACTERSET';
</pre>
Then you can create a tablespace in the database and create a user whose default tablespace is the newly created one.</p>
<p>Typically, you would do this prior to installation so the installer can set these properties in the configuration
   files for you, and test that they are valid. If you do this after an install, you can manually modify the settings in the local.properties
   files. See the examples below and
   adjust to match your environment.
</p>

<h3>Example MySQL local.properties settings</h3>

<pre>
username@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=user
password@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=pwd
vendor@org.sakaiproject.db.api.SqlService=mysql
driverClassName@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
validationQuery@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=select 1 from DUAL
defaultTransactionIsolationString@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
url@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cle_dbname?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useServerPrepStmts=false&cachePrepStmts=true&prepStmtCacheSize=4096&prepStmtCacheLimit=4096
</pre>

<h3>Example Oracle local.properties settings</h3>

<pre>
username@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=user
password@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=pwd

testOnBorrow@javax.sql.BaseDataSource=false
# for oracle 9
#hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle9iDialect
# for oracle 10
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect
</pre>
